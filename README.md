## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### 1. "ModuleNotFoundError" when running the application

**Problem:** Python can't find required modules like `langchain` or `google-generativeai`

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
pip list | grep langchain
pip list | grep google-generativeai
```

**Additional checks:**

- Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher: `python --version`
- Check if you're in the correct directory: `ls` should show `main.py`
- Try installing packages individually if batch install fails

#### 2. "API key not found" or Authentication Errors

**Problem:** The application can't access your Gemini API key

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Verify .env file content (should show your key)
cat .env

# Recreate .env file if missing
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and add your actual API key
```

**Common .env file issues:**

- **Extra spaces:** `GEMINI_API_KEY = your_key` ❌ → `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` ✅
- **Quotes:** `GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"` ❌ → `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` ✅
- **Wrong variable name:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key` ❌ → `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` ✅

**Getting a new API key:**

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key to your `.env` file

#### 3. "Rate limit exceeded" or Quota Errors

**Problem:** You've hit API usage limits

**Solutions:**

- **Wait and retry:** The app has built-in retry logic, just wait 2-5 minutes
- **Check your quota:** Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/) to check usage
- **Upgrade plan:** Consider upgrading if you need higher limits
- **Reduce requests:** Use shorter symptom descriptions

**Rate limiting tips:**

- The app automatically waits between retries
- Avoid running multiple instances simultaneously
- Use the test suite sparingly during development

#### 4. Network and Connection Issues

**Problem:** Can't connect to Google's API servers

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Test internet connectivity
ping google.com

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup generativelanguage.googleapis.com

# Check firewall/proxy settings
# Corporate networks may block API access
```

**Network troubleshooting:**

- Try a different network (mobile hotspot)
- Check if your firewall blocks Python applications
- Verify proxy settings if in corporate environment
- Ensure your router/ISP isn't blocking Google services

#### 5. Python Version and Environment Issues

**Problem:** Compatibility issues with Python version or environment

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.8+)
python --version

# Check pip version
pip --version

# Create fresh virtual environment
python -m venv fresh_venv
# Activate and install
fresh_venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Environment best practices:**

- Always use virtual environments
- Don't install packages globally
- Keep Python updated (3.8+ required)
- Use `python -m pip` instead of just `pip` if issues persist

### Runtime Issues

#### 6. Application Crashes or Freezes

**Problem:** App stops responding or crashes unexpectedly

**Solutions:**

- **Keyboard interrupt:** Press `Ctrl+C` to safely exit
- **Memory issues:** Restart the application
- **Long processing:** Wait up to 30 seconds for API responses

**Debugging steps:**

```bash
# Run with verbose output
python main.py 2>&1 | tee debug.log

# Check system resources
# Windows: Task Manager
# macOS/Linux: top or htop
```

#### 7. Unexpected or Poor AI Responses

**Problem:** AI gives wrong specialists or poor reasoning

**Possible causes:**

- **Vague symptoms:** Provide more detailed descriptions
- **API issues:** Temporary service problems
- **Model limitations:** AI isn't perfect

**Improvement tips:**

- Be specific about symptoms: "sharp chest pain" vs "chest discomfort"
- Include timing: "started 2 hours ago" vs "recent"
- Mention severity: "severe pain (8/10)" vs "some pain"
- Add context: "after eating" or "during exercise"

#### 8. Input Validation Errors

**Problem:** App rejects your symptom descriptions

**Common validation issues:**

- **Too short:** Need at least 5 characters
- **Too long:** Keep under 2000 characters
- **Invalid characters:** Stick to letters, numbers, basic punctuation
- **Excessive repetition:** Avoid "aaaaa" or repeated words

**Good symptom descriptions:**

```
✅ "Sharp stabbing pain in lower right abdomen for 3 hours, with nausea"
✅ "Persistent dry cough for 2 weeks, worse at night"
✅ "Sudden severe headache with sensitivity to light"

❌ "pain"
❌ "I feel bad"
❌ "aaaaahhhhh my stomach hurts so much!!!!!!"
```

### Testing and Validation

#### 9. Running Sample Test Cases

**Problem:** Want to verify the system works correctly

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Quick test (4 cases)
python sample_test_cases.py --quick

# Full test suite (20+ cases)
python sample_test_cases.py

# List available tests
python sample_test_cases.py --list
```

**Interpreting test results:**

- **80%+ success rate:** Excellent performance
- **60-80% success rate:** Good, some tuning may help
- **<60% success rate:** Check API key, network, or model issues

#### 10. Performance Optimization

**Problem:** App is slow or uses too many API calls

**Optimization tips:**

- **Shorter descriptions:** Reduce token usage
- **Batch testing:** Use test suite instead of manual testing
- **Cache results:** For development, consider caching responses
- **Rate limiting:** Built-in delays prevent API abuse

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### 11. LangChain Integration Issues

**Problem:** Errors related to LangChain framework

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check LangChain version
pip show langchain

# Update LangChain if needed
pip install --upgrade langchain

# Verify Google integration
python -c "from langchain.llms import GoogleGenerativeAI; print('OK')"
```

#### 12. Environment Variable Issues

**Problem:** Variables not loading correctly

**Debugging:**

```python
# Add to main.py for debugging
import os
print("Current directory:", os.getcwd())
print("Environment variables:", dict(os.environ))
print("API key found:", bool(os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')))
```

#### 13. Logging and Debugging

**Enable detailed logging:**

```python
# Add to top of main.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

**Check log files:**

- Look for error patterns
- Note API response times
- Monitor retry attempts
